# Custom React Boiler Plate - by tochi
Tochi's react boiler plate from scratch. I configured
- Babel
- Webpack
- and their respective plugins
- and enabled hot reloading

This is a little experiment to gain a little more knowledge of how react works under the hood by setting it up without create-react-app

will try this experiment again, but with parcel.
